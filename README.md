# NZ COVID Tracer

This is the repository for the [NZ COVID Tracer app](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-resources-and-tools/nz-covid-tracer-app).

NZ COVID Tracer is a Ministry of Health app that allows you to create a digital
diary of places you visit by scanning the official QR codes. This gives contact
tracers a headstart with identifying anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19
so we can quickly break the chain of transmission.

You can download the app for:

* **Android** from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.govt.health.covidtracer)
* **iPhone/iOS** from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/id1511667597)
